<body> If it is physically possible to simulate a universe, then the likelihood that you are reading this in the prime universe becomes vanishingly small. What are you risking by assuming that this you is the real you in the real universe?
What weight might your decisions have on other instances of yourself that may or may not exist? Any decent simulation of this universe would require autonomous
decision makers, pseudo-beings that love and want and fuck and fear death. A pseudo-you that resembles the prime you in every way, more real to you than the real you.
What if after SilkBias there is entropy?
